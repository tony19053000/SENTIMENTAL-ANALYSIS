**<h2>Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>**

This project implements Sentiment Analysis using both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. It focuses on classifying the sentiment of text data (such as product reviews, tweets, etc.) as positive, negative, or neutral. The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook (Sentiment_analysis_using_ML_and_DL.ipynb), which includes data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.

**<h2>Project Overview</h2>**

The goal of this project is to classify text data based on the sentiment expressed. The project utilizes both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to evaluate and compare the performance in sentiment analysis tasks. The steps include:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, vectorization, etc.).
Model training using ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Building a Deep Learning (DL) model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
Comparing the performance of ML and DL approaches.

**<h2>Technologies Used</h2>**
Python 3.x

Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models.

TensorFlow/Keras for building and training deep learning models.

NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing.

Pandas for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

**<h2>Dataset</h2>**

The project utilizes a publicly available sentiment analysis dataset, such as:

IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset for binary classification (positive/negative).

Twitter Sentiment140 Dataset for sentiment analysis on tweets.

Custom dataset (depending on the use case).

The dataset is typically pre-labeled with sentiments, and the text data is cleaned to remove stopwords, special characters, and irrelevant data.

Approach
1. Text Preprocessing
Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words like "is", "the", "a" which do not contribute to the sentiment.
Vectorization: Converting text into numerical form using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
2. Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A more complex algorithm that works well with high-dimensional spaces.
Both models are trained on the preprocessed text data and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Deep Learning Models
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): These models are designed to capture the sequential nature of text data, handling longer dependencies between words.
The DL model is built using Keras with embedding layers for word representation and LSTM layers for capturing the context of the sentences.

**Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the application of both traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis. While ML algorithms are easier to implement and faster to train, DL models, particularly LSTM, capture the contextual nuances better and offer improved performance on complex text data. The project highlights the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy in choosing between ML and DL models.
